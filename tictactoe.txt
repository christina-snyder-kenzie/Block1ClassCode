Make a n-sized tic-tac-toe game with a save/load feature if you can't finish a game and want to come back to it

Terminal Based Game (Display/Receive Information)

Should we have a game board object?
	Constructor:
		Board Coordinates / A GRID 
		
	RecordMove
	Do we have a winner? Or is it a draw? or do we keep playing?
	
		N in a row/column/or diagonal
		Or run out of slots
		public enum Result {
			P1_WINS,
			P2_WINS,
			DRAW,
			KEEP_GOING,
			TIME_TO_SAVE
		}

		public Result findWinner(){
			if player 1 wins
				return Result.P1_WINS;
		}

Should we have a game PLAY object?
	Constructor: Load players
		We'll ask: Computer or Player? 
	Do you want to load a game or start from scratch?

	Keeps track of current player
	playing = !winner && numTurns < numSlots
	While (board.findWinner() == Result.KEEP_GOING){
		Use scanner to get coordinates?

		Do you want to save or keep going? (type s to save);
		if (they type s){
			BoardSaver.save(board)
		}
	}

Do we need a BoardSaver object/class?
	Two static methods:
		Load(File)
			returns a board with the loaded state
		Save(board)
			writes it to a file

Players -> Whose turn it is (X or O)

Scanner -> In a loop!?

Option to save while playing
