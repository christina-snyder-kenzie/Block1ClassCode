If I give you the name of disney movie, can you show me the cast?
	(No, you cannot google the movie)

Things we know:
	We have a disney API
	You can search it with Movies
	Characters have an IMG_URL
	You can use IMG_URL with HTML to view the pictures
	You can use FileIO to write HTML

Things we're gonna have to do:
	1. Get the movie first
	2. URL Formatter
		Path
	3. Some JSON Action
		Need the URL with the path
		1. Make a HTTP Request
		2. Receive the response
		3. Convert it to DTO so we can access the data
	4. CastDTO
	5. Build the HTML file
		Dig into the DTO
		Accessing all the IMG_URLs
	6. BufferedWriter (Write to a file)
	




HTTP Requests result in a RESPONSE
	That response body is typically, JSON
	That JSON can be read INTO a DTO
		Using an ObjectMapper
